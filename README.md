[week 3 reflection:](https://editor.p5js.org/tasi_ann/sketches/BP4ln_ugN)
During class, I've been trying to figure out at least rotation, so when we were learning for statements, I was able to have a better understanding of rotation at least. The main thing I've been trying to do is figure out how to include time segments that can work. I linked my sketch so far, but I think my next step is getting a certain aesthetic that the clock will take time. I'm thinking of maybe doing a timer for desserts/sweets, or doing a clock that's a bit behind the normal clock for those who run on what my culture refers to as "island time".
